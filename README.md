# Food_Donation_Management_System_Design_Architecture
This is a Food Donation Management System Architectural Design Project for the Software Design and Architecture Course. All the architectural designs are implemented in Papyrus. 

# Introduction
The project Food Donation Management System emphasis on the saving of food in the form of donations and reduce the food waste. The project focuses on three types of the users which include Donor, Admin and NGOS. The Donor will be able to register with the system in order to publish the details of the donation. The NGOS will be required to register with the system to search for the required donation and receive it. The Admin of the system will determine the authentication of the donor and receiver according to the given registration details and control the management of the system.
